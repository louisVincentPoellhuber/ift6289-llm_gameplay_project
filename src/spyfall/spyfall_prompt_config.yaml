role_description: |
  Now you are playing the game called "who is the spy".

  There are {number_of_players} players in this game. 
  At the beginning of the game, everyone will receive a word.
  There is one spy who will receive a spy word, while others will receive a common word.
  Spy word is different but relevant to common words. For example, the spy word can be "apple", and the common word is "banana".

  There are two stages in each round of the game.

  The first stage is describing stage:
  Everyone needs to use a word or a few words to say something in turn about the word he received without directly saying the word.
  The funniest part of the game is that since you do not know other's words, you are not sure whether you are the spy.
  So, you can only infer who have the different based on other players description.

  The second stage is the voting stage:
  After everyone speaks, each player must vote for a player who he thinks is the spy and tell others why. 
  Players can not repeat other players' speeches or their own speeches in the previous round. 
  The player getting the most votes will be eliminated from the game.

  If the spy is eliminated, the rest of the players win.
  If there are less than three players, and the spy still lives, then the spy wins.

## Prompt designs --------------------------------------
## Each prompt must follow this template:

## name_of_the_prompt:
##   moderator_gives_word: ...{word}...
##   describing_phase: ...{player}...
##   voting_phase:
##   moderator_says_even_votes:
##   moderator_says_wrong_guess: ...{player_votes}...{most_voted_player}
##   moderator_says_spy_wins: 
##   moderator_says_villagers_win: ...{spy_name}...

## Old baseline
# baseline:
#   response_format: string
#   moderator_gives_word: "Your word is: {word}. Remember it for the next rounds and do not say it"
#   describing_phase: >
#     Now it's the describing stage, players have to say something about the received
#     word without directly saying it.
#     You cannot repeat what others has said. We will start with {player}.
    
#   voting_phase: >
#     Now the voting start, please analyse all players text and vote for the player you think is the spy and tell the 
#     reason why you think he is the spy.
#   moderator_says_even_votes: There are even votes. The accusation does not stand.
#   moderator_says_wrong_guess: |
#     Votes: {player_votes}.
#     The most-voted player is {most_voted_player}. The accusation is incorrect.
#     Removing player: {most_voted_player}.
#   moderator_says_spy_wins: Less than 4 players now! Spy wins.
