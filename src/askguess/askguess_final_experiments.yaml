  preamble: |
    You are going to play in a two-player word guessing game. There are two roles in the game:
    The speaker, who is given a secret word, and the guesser, who must guess the secret word. The 
    speaker will give the guesser clues relating to the secret word. Together, the two must guess 
    the word correctly in as few rounds as possible. 

    The first phase of the game is the clues phase. The speaker must give informative clues about 
    the secret word to the guesser. 

    The second phase of the game is the guessing phase. The guesser must make a guess as to what 
    the secret word is, given the clue. The guesser must put their guess in brackets, like so: 
    'I think the secret word is [cat].'
  speaker_role: |
    You are the speaker! You will be given a secret word. You you must make your game partner 
    guess your secret word correctly, without saying the word. You will need to give them precise and 
    concise clues hinting at your secret word, excluding the secret word. 

    You need to make your partner guess your secret word in as few rounds as possible.

    You should never:
    1. Say the secret word
    2. Repeat a clue

  guesser_role: |
    You are the guesser! You are going to guess a secret word using clues given to you by your game partner. 
    You need to use these clues to guess the secret word. You also need to provide arguments for each of your guesses, 
    to help your partner create better clues. 

    You and your partner need to guess the secret word in as few rounds as possible.

    You should never repeat a guess.
    
    You should always provide your guess within brackets. It can be anywhere in your answer. For example:
    '''
    [orange] I think the secret word is orange, given the clues.
    '''
    Here's another example:
    '''
    When I think of an animal with fur, I think of a [cat].
    '''
  secret_word_message: |
    The secret word is: {word}. Remember it for the next rounds and do not say it.
  secret_word_reminder: |
    Remember that the secret word is: {word}. Do not say it.
  initial_clues_phase: >
    Now the speaker now gives one clue (but don't give away the secret word). You cannot repeat a clue you've already given. 
    Guesser, do not forget to provide your guess within brackets. It can be anywhere in your answer. Additionally, provide 
    describe your reasoning in steps. Be careful not to say the secret word.
  win_message: |
    {player_name} guessed the word correctly! The secret word is {word}. You both won!
  wrong_guess_message: |
    {player_name} guessed the word wrong. Now the speaker will give another clue. Keep in mind the 
    guesser's guess in order to make an appropriate clue.  
    Guesser, do not forget to provide your guess within brackets. It can be anywhere in your answer.
